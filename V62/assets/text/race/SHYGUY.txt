DESC: 
"Childish hoodlums with no respect for civilization. They're crafty but nearly impossible to keep in line",

DESC_LONG:
"All shy guys care about is having fun, usually at the expense at everyone else. A Shy Guy enclave can make a real mess of a town, making them unpopular with most other races.
However, if you can maintain order you'll find they're master craftsmen, and put up quite the fight!",
